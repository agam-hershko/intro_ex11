# Boogle Game

This project is a graphical implementation of the popular word game "Boggle".
The game is played on a 4x4 grid of letter buttons, and the player's goal is to
 find as many valid English words as possible within a given time limit.

## Features:
- Randomized letter board: The game generates a new random board of letters
  for each round.
- Interactive GUI: The graphical user interface allows players to select
  letters, form words, and submit them.
- Word validation: The game verifies if the submitted words are valid English
  words using a dictionary (boggle_dict.txt).
- Scoring: Points are awarded based on the length of the submitted words.
- Timer: The game includes a countdown timer to add a time pressure element.
  The timer turns red when time is running out.
- Word tracking: The game displays a list of found words, the current word
  being formed, and the player's score.
- Best score tracking: The game keeps track of the best score achieved in
  previous rounds.
- Longest word tracking: The game displays the longest word found during the
  current round.
- Button highlighting: The color of a letter button changes when the player
  hovers over it, providing visual feedback.
- Button deselecting: Clicking on a selected letter button again deselects it,
  allowing players to change their selection.
